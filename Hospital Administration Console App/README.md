The program stimulates a Hospital Administration Console App that can execute many different commands.
The commands includes adding a patient to the system, performing a patient's ID lookup, treating a patient in triage,
printing out a patient's information as a report, printing out a report of all treated patients,
finding out the next patient to be treated, printing out a report of all the patients in triage, treating all patients in triage, printing out of all 
patients by doctor, adding patients into the system from a file, turning debug mode on, turning debug mode off, quitting the application, and opening a help guide.

The program will prompt you to enter a number for the option you would like to choose. Once the option is chosen, you will be able to execute the command you 
chosen, and you will be continuously prompted to enter a number for a option until the option quit is chosen. 

The option help, which is the last option listed as 14, explains what each command performs, and how to correctly use the commands.
