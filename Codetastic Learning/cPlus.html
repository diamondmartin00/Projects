<h2>What is C++?</h2>
<p>C++ is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. It is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, which is perfect for those who are new to programming. It was designed to be very easy for developers to read and translate, with its syntax focusing on readability.
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>Python is designed with an easy to read and use syntax, which makes it simplier to develop for. It is bundled with its own development environment known as IDLE, which makes it easy to test small parts of code. In addition to numbers and strings, you can create lists and dictionaries. It also supports object-oriented programming with classes. Finally, Python is compatible on most operating systems, such as Windows, Mac, Linux, and even Android and iOS through unofficial builds.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1979, Danish programmer, Bjarne Stroustrup was using the programming lanugage, Simula, while working on his Ph.D. thesis. Simula was considered to be one of the languages to support object-oriented programming. Stroustrup however, found it too slow to be practical. He then started work on "C with Classes", </p>
<h2>Uses of C++</h2>
<p>Python has many financial uses; it can be used for developing trade and risk management platforms, as well as for payment and online banking. Python is also used to write software for ATMs, because its math syntax is very flexibilty when it comes to math-related tasks. The "Big Data" industry also uses Python, because programs that use it use fewer lines of code than other languages. You can even use Python in developing games, especially text-bsaed adventures, even as a beginner.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Jobs that Use C++</h2>
<p>Python is used by many companies of many different fields, such as Data Science, Web Development, and Finances. Banks in particular, hire a lot of programmers. The average US salary for python programmers is about $92,000 a year.
