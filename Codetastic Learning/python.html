<h2>What is Python?</h2>
    <p>
        Python is a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language. It is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, which is perfect for those who are new to programming. It was designed to be very easy for developers to read and translate, with its syntax focusing on readability.
    </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
        Python is designed with an easy to read and use syntax, which makes it simplier to develop for. It is bundled with its own development environment known as IDLE, which makes it easy to test small parts of code. In addition to numbers and strings, you can create lists and dictionaries. It also supports object-oriented programming with classes. Finally, Python is compatible on most operating systems, such as Windows, Mac, Linux, and even Android and iOS through unofficial builds.
    </p>
<h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Python was created in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum. Rossum had previously used a programming language known as ABC. He found the language frustrating to use, so he decided to develop an easier to use version of ABC. He named the language Python, after the British comedy group, Monty Python. After years of development, Rossum released Python version 1.0, in January of 1994. Python would receive incremental updates for the next six years, with its final update released in September 2000. The following month, Python 2.0 was released. This version allowed for the use of Unicode strings. This allowed for support for 65,536 distinct characters, as opposed to the ASCII system allowing only 256. It also introduced Augmented Assignment operators, which are essentially short-form ways of typing an operation. For example, a += 2 is the same as a = a + 2. Rossum continued to work on Python until July of 2018, but it is still receiving updates to the language, with the latest update, 3.7.3, being released on March 25, 2019.

<h2>Uses of Python</h2>
<p>Python has many financial uses; it can be used for developing trade and risk management platforms, as well as for payment and online banking. Python is also used to write software for ATMs, because its math syntax is very flexibilty when it comes to math-related tasks. The "Big Data" industry also uses Python, because programs that use it use fewer lines of code than other languages. You can even use Python in developing games, especially text-based adventures, even as a beginner.</p>
<p>Some well-known applications and websites that utilize Python</p>
<ul>
	<li>Dropbox (which was founded by Guido van Rossum)</li>
	<li>Instagram</li>
	<li>Netflix</li>
	<li>Spotify</li>
	<li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<h2>Jobs that Use Python</h2>
    <p>Python is used by many companies of many different fields, such as Data Science, Web Development, and Finances. Banks in particular, hire a lot of programmers. The average US salary for python programmers is about $92,000 a year.</p>
