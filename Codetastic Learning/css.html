        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
			CSS was adopted 10 years later than Html in 1994. CSS is a declaritive programming language. When using CSS, you do not tell the browser exactly how to render the page but describe the rules for the HTML document. In 1996, W3C has established the detailed specification for the CSS coding standards have been created.
			
            C# was designed to be general purpose, high-level; fully object-oriented as well as a component-oriented programming language. Anders Hejlsberg is the creator of this widely used programming language. The language was based on C++ and Java with additional extensions, libraries, and concepts for implementing different OOPS and component-oriented programming concepts.

        <h2>Difficulty of CSS</h2>
        <p>
			CSS is very easy to learn but prgressively it becomes more challangeing as you learn CSS.  
        </p>
        <h2>Framework of CSS</h2>
        <p>	
			CSS has many features that is still missing. An example are features for more complex layouts. CSS lets developers deal with user interfaces rather than documents. CSS saves multiple layout all at once. All major websites use the CSS in their programming. CSS external stylesheet files are easy to change. The entire website can be changed with one file.
			
			CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block. an example is (selector)(declaration). the slector points to the HTML element you want to style and the declaration block includes details that can change color, align text, and do whatever you want. The attribute adds color to your program and allows your website to have unique characteristics within each selecter.
			
			CSS also has an id selector that selects specific element. It uses a character #(hash) that identifies specific item. id class selects multiple elements such as  .textcolor {color: #FF0066;}, you can call out to the .textcolor like [p class="textcolor"] to call out the color every time.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selector</li>
            <li>Declaration</li>
            <li>id selector</li>
            <li>class selector</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
			CSS is flexible and using it can get you the needed skills to build a basic website. All websites use CSS and those who used it know that css selects and detail a delcaration of certain elements within your HTML.
			
			CSS is also easy to change by changing the code. Easy to interact and easy to handle with many tutorial online to help you learn how to use CSS. There are also a ton of downloadable CSS templates out there which are fun to look at.
			
			Compared to any languages such as Java, C#, or anyother language, CSS is considered a toy language because of how easy it is compared to the other languages out there. CSS cannot create sophisticated scripts, so most websites will use extra plugins to fill in the gap in detailing.
        </p>
