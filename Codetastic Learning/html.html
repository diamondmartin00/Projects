        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            First developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is used to create web pages that are displayed on the World Wide Web. HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that your Internet browser may display them as they are intended to look. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).
        </p>
        <h2>Difficulty of Html</h2>
        <p>
           HTML is a fairly straightforward and simple language to learn. That by itself is enough to make learning JavaScript a lot more difficult than HTML. While a markup language describes what something is, a programming language defines a series of actions to be performed. As far as which is easier to learn, HTML is definitely easier. 
        </p>
        <h2>Framework of Html</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is a HyperText Markup Language file format used as the basis of a web page. HTML is a file extension used interchangeably with HTM. HTML consists of tags surrounded by angle brackets. The HTML tags can be used to define headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and interactive forms. It can also be used to embed Javascript, and CSS.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Html</h2>
        <p>
            HTML is the language used to build the structural layer of web pages. It informs the browser about things such as "This is a paragraph", "This is a table of data", "This is a side note", "This is a header", and so on. The role of HTML is to tell the machine what kind of content a piece of information is intended to be. Itâ€™s a markup language.
