        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Java began being developed in 1991. At that time, James Gosling from Sun Microsystems and his team began designing the first version of Java aimed at programming home appliances which are controlled by a wide variety of computer processors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gosling's new language needed to be accessible by a variety of computer processors. In 1994, he realized that such a language would be ideal for use with web browsers and Java's connection to the internet began. In 1995, Netscape Incorporated released its latest version of the Netscape browser which was capable of running Java programs.
        </p>
        <h2>Difficulty of Java</h2>
        <p>
            Java is considered a more complex programming language to learn than Python for beginners. Therefore, it's recommended for beginners to learn Python first.
        </p>
        <h2>Framework of Java</h2>
        <p>	
			As an object-oriented language, Java supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of Java</h2>
