        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            C# was designed to be general purpose, high-level; fully object-oriented as well as a component-oriented programming language. Anders Hejlsberg is the creator of this widely used programming language. The language was based on C++ and Java with additional extensions, libraries, and concepts for implementing different OOPS and component-oriented programming concepts.
        </p>
        <h2>Difficulty of C#</h2>
        <p>
            C# is considered to be an easy language to learn due to the language being simple and modern. The language was designed to be easy to use but is slightly more complex than Python.
        </p>
        <h2>Framework of C#</h2>
        <p>
            C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ and provides powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, lambda expressions and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code. Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) expressions make the strongly-typed query a first-class language construct.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# makes it easy to develop software components through several innovative language constructs, including the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable type-safe event notifications.</li>
            <li>Properties, which serve as accessors for private member variables.</li>
            <li>Attributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time.</li>
            <li>Inline XML documentation comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) which provides built-in query capabilities across a variety of data sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have to interact with other Windows software such as COM objects or native Win32 DLLs, you can do this in C# through a process called "Interop". Interop enables C# programs to do almost anything that a native C++ application can do. C# even supports pointers and the concept of "unsafe" code for those cases in which direct memory access is absolutely critical.
        </p>
        <p>
            The C# build process is simple compared to C and C++ and more flexible than in Java. There are no separate header files, and no requirement that methods and types be declared in a particular order. A C# source file may define any number of classes, structs, interfaces, and events.
        </p>
        <h2>Use of C#</h2>
        <p>
            C# is used for building .NET applications. When you write a C# application you are using .NET Framework. So all the applications which you can develop in .NET you can also use C# in those applications.There are many different types of applications developed in .NET.Some of the common applications developed in C# are: 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows Services Long running process without UI</li>
            <li>Web Applications Client Server Applications</li>
            <li>Windows Applications Applications which runs on desktops</li>
            <li>Web Services Applications which provides functionality over HTTP</li>
            <li>Games Using Unity</li>
            <li>Console Applications Applications which donâ€™t have UI</li>
            <li>WokFlow Applications Applications that automates processes</li>
            <li>Class Libraries Applications which provides functionality to other applications</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Jobs that You can Acquire</h2>
        <p>
            C# is used amongst the wide spectrum of companies. Therefore, there are plenty job opportunities in C# from small startups to giant corporations. C# programmers salary range from $55,000 to $121,000 with an average salary of $89,672.
