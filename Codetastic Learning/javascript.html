<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
<p>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to implement more complex things onto a web page. It allows for object-oriented programming for web browsers.</p>
<h2>Framework</h2>
<p>JavaScript's syntax is very similar to that of Java, which was done to allow the language to gain more traction, and become easier to pick up for more experienced programmers. It is based around scripts and functions that interact with HTML and CSS that allow for more complex programs.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>In 1995, the Netscape Communicator browser was gaining popularity against its rival, NCSA Mosiac. Netscape Communcations founder, Marc Andeessen, believed that the interent needed a way to become more dynamic, so a scripting language for the internet was needed. He didn't want to cater the language toward those with software development experience, as another language, Java, was looking to fufill that audience. Instead, he decided to focus towards designers and non-programmers. So he began development on a language known as Mocha, which would be released as a prototype to Netscape in 1995. Later that year, Mocha was renamed JavaScript. The language was officially standardized in 1997 and its first official version was released. Since then, versions of JavaScirpt have been referred to as ECMAScript. Major updates were released over the next few decades adding features such as regular expressions and the do while block. The latest version, ECMAScript 2018, was released in June of 2018.</p>
<h2>Uses of JavaScript</h2>
<p>JavaScript is primarily used in web sites and applications. Almost anything interactive on a web page is created using JavaScript. It is also used for building web servers.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Jobs that Use C++</h2>
<p>JavaScript was the 2nd most in-demand programming language in 2017, only behind Java. Various companies will hire JavaScript programmers to work on their websites. The average salary for a JavaScript programmer is about $84,500.</p>
